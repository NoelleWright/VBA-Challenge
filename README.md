# VBA-Challenge
 Purpose: 
 The purpose of this module is to refactor data in a stock analysis to determine ways to make code run in a Visual Basic (VBA) program editor through Excel. We will use data from an excel spreadsheet to loop through different datasets of different years through an analysis. 
 
 Results:
 With the results, we can conclude that in the year 2017, there was a greater return yield for the stock analysis completed that year. With this process, it was very challenging due to the fact that the data collected for the years 2017-2018 was a larger data set that made the macros in the VBA editor run slower. There were many steps that had to be re-done to make the editing process go smooth. An advantage of the analysis was that once the data was completed, the table structure was formatted well and it helped to run the timing of each analysis in a clear way.
